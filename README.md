Project Title: Sports Image Classification with CNN using TensorFlow and Keras

Project Description: Classification of sports disciplines from images with different pre-trained and custom CNN models. The goal is to determine whether a set of images presents sports activities or not, and if yes, which sports discipline it is. 

The dataset contains labeled images of 16 different sports disciplines and “no sport” label, as follows:

0: Airsoft, 
1: Beach volleyball,
2: Cycle polo,
3: Flag football,
4: Karate,
5: Motocross,
6: Muay Thai,
7: Nordic skiing,
8: Olympic weightlifting,
9: Parachuting,
10: Rallycross, 
11: Roller hockey,
12: Rugby union,
13: Sprint car racing,
14: Table tennis,
15: Wakeboarding,
16: no sport

Different models are tested during the project. 

The best result with an accuracy of 84.94% has been achieved using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

Dependencies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras
